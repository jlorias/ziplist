# ziplist
-----
 ICS 314 Practice WOD (E27). Write a function called
 zipList that accepts two lists of equal length and
 returns the result of alternatingly taking elements.
 For example: given the two lists [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’] and 
 [1, 2, 3], the function should return [‘a’, 1, ‘b’, 2, ‘c’, 3].
 zipList should not use Underscore. Now write a function called
 zipListTheSimpleWay that does the same thing using Underscore.
